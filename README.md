# Differentiable Architecture Search Meets Network Pruning at Initialization: A More Reliable, Efficient, and Flexible Framework

This repository is the implementation of Differentiable Architecture Search Meets Network Pruning at Initialization: A More Reliable, Efficient, and Flexible Framework. 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
Following DARTS and NAS-Bench-201 install requirements, download NAS-Bench-201-v1_1-096897.pth from https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Y0UwGisiouVRxW-W5hEtbxmcHw_0hF_/view
```


## Search on NAS-Bench-201

The reproducible codes could be found in NAS_Bench201/exps/algos/FreeDARTS_Synflow_oneshot.ipynb


## Search on DARTS space

The codes for FreeDARTS could be found in DARTS_CNN/FreeDARTS_Synflow_oneshot.ipynb

The codes FOR FreeDARTS$\dagger$ could be found in DARTS_CNN/FreeDARTS_Synflow_oneshot_20cells.ipynb

The codes FOR FreeDARTS$\ddagger$ could be found in DARTS_CNN/FreeDARTS_Synflow_ImageNet_oneshot.ipynb


## Searched architectures

The searched architectures with 5 different seeds can be found in the DARTS_CNN/genotypes.py


## Pre-trained Models

You can get pretrained models and log files in DARTS_CNN/trained_models
